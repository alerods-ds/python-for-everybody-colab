# Python for Everybody - Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises in the book [*Python for Everybody*](https://www.py4e.com/) by Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck). Using executable notebooks in Google Colab, I apply core Python concepts to key data analysis tasks, including data structures, file processing, regular expressions, APIs, databases, and data visualization. This project is part of building my data science profile by integrating computational tools with my background in the exact sciences.

## 🧠 Motivation

This project stems from my interest in strengthening and applying fundamental Python skills with a focus on a career in data science. Working through this material allows me to:

- Reinforce core concepts through hands-on practice.
- Use Google Colab as a regular working environment.
- Document the learning process with clear, reproducible explanations.
- Maintain an accessible and well-structured reference as part of my professional development.
