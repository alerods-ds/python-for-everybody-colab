        "\n",
        "- **`if`, `elif`, and `else` statements**: I learned how to structure branching logic to handle different situations based on user input, such as computing overtime pay or assigning letter grades based on numerical scores.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Comparison operators**: I gained practice using `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and logical conditions (`and`, `or`) to control program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`try` and `except` blocks**: I learned how to write programs that can gracefully handle invalid user input without crashing. This is essential for building robust and user-friendly applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Type conversion and input validation**: I practiced converting user input from strings to floating-point numbers using `float()`, and validating that input is within expected ranges (e.g., between `0.0` and `1.0`).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Code clarity and readability**: I also learned how small improvementsâ€”like checking for invalid input first or simplifying conditional logicâ€”can make code more readable and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts are foundational to programming, and mastering them will help me tackle more complex problems with confidence.\n"
