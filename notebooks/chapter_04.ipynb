        "In Chapter 4, I learned how to define and use functions in Python to organize code more effectively. Specifically:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `def` keyword is used to create functions, allowing me to group reusable blocks of code under a name.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Function definitions must appear before they are called in the program, or else Python will raise an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "- I learned how to pass arguments to functions and how to use return to send back a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Writing functions helps avoid repetition, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- I also saw how important it is to manage the order of definitions and calls when structuring a script.\n",
        "\n",
        "By rewriting previous programs using functions, I saw how modularity improves both readability and reusability."
